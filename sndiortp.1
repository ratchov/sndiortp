.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility records audio from the
.Xr sndio 7
audio device and sends it over the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
to the given network addresses.
Similarly it may receive any number of audio streams
.Pq Fl l
over RTP and play the resulting mix on the local audio device.
Only 16-bit and 24-bit PCM payloads are supported, making
.Nm
suitable for local network areas only.
By default
.Nm
uses UDP port 5004.
.Pp
As the remote and local device clocks are not synchronized,
the inbound RTP stream sample rate is slightly adjusted by resampling it.
This ensures that the time between a sample is received and the time
it is played stays constant.
If an inbound network packet is lost, playback of the stream restarts:
a reliable network with reserved bandwidth is thus recommended.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar size
The RTP receive buffer size in frames.
Default is 50ms, i.e. 2400 frames at the default sample rate.
.It Fl c Ar channels
The RTP channels count.
The default is 2, i.e. stereo.
.It Fl f Ar device
Use this
.Xr sndio 7
audio device.
Default is
.Pa default .
.It Fl l No rtp:// Ns Oo Ar address Oc Ns Op : Ns Ar port
Accept RTP streams on the given local network address.
If no
.Ar address
is provided, then
.Nm
will accept packets from any address.
.It Fl n Ar count
Maximum number of RTP streams
.Nm
will accept.
Default is 256.
.It Fl p Ar bits
The RTP bits per sample.
Only 16 and 24 are supported.
Default is 24.
.It Fl r Ar rate
Sample rate in Hertz of the RTP stream.
The default is
.Cm 48000 .
.It Fl v
Increase log verbosity.
.It Fl w
Don't exit if there are no RTP streams.
May be used to test the audio device.
.It Fl x
Do not adjust the RTP source sample rate to the local audio device sample rate.
Unless the local and remote clocks are synchronized, the
receive buffer will overrun or underrun, causing
.Nm
to reset periodically.
.It Fl z Ar size
The audio device block size in frames.
Default is 10ms, i.e. 480 frames at the default sample rate.
.El
.Pp
If
.Nm
is sent
.Dv SIGINT ,
it drains the play buffer and exits.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Receive RTP streams on port 5120 and play the resulting mix:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ sndiortp -l rtp://:5120
.Ed
.Pp
Send recorded data to 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.2 port 5120:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ sndiortp rtp://192.168.0.1:5120 rtp://192.168.0.2:5120
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sndio 7
.Sh BUGS
Resampling is low quality.
.Pp
Playback is limited to 64 streams.
